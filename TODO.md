## UI/UX

## Grades
- [ ] Move grades from a message to an inline keyboard with pagination.
- [ ] Implement filtering for specific subjects in the grades view.

- [ ] Add the student's overall average and the class overall average in the grades message.

## Homework
- [ ] Move homework from a message to an inline keyboard with pagination.
- [ ] Add functionality for students to mark homework as completed within the bot and even ask the AI to do it.
- [ ] Provide reminders for unfinished homework close to their due date.

## AI Integration
- [ ] Add a menu in the settings to allow students to give personalized information so the AI can better understand and assist them.

## Multi-language Support
