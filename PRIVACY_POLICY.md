# Privacy Policy for Pronote Telegram Bot

**Last Updated: 11/09/2024**

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use the Pronote Telegram Bot (the "Bot").

## 1. Information We Collect
We collect only the minimum personal information necessary to provide the services of the Bot. This includes:

- **Telegram User ID**: Used to identify users and manage their session within the bot.
- **Pronote Credentials**: Your Pronote username and password are temporarily stored during an active session but are never stored permanently on our servers or logs.
- **Bot Commands**: We collect information about the commands you issue to the Bot (e.g., `/login`, `/grades`) to respond accordingly.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
We use your personal information in the following ways:

- **To Log Into Pronote**: Your Pronote credentials are used to log into the Pronote service and fetch the requested data (e.g., grades, homework, timetable).
- **To Provide Bot Services**: Information such as your user ID and issued commands are used to deliver personalized responses.

No personal data is sold, rented, or shared with third parties, except when required by law.

## 3. Data Storage
- **Session Data**: User credentials are only stored temporarily during the active session and deleted when the session ends (e.g., upon issuing the `/logout` command or when the session expires).
- **Logs**: Only basic interaction data (such as the time and type of command issued) is stored in server logs for debugging and improving the service. These logs do not include sensitive information such as Pronote credentials.

## 4. Data Security
We take data security seriously and employ industry-standard measures to protect your data. However, no system can be entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

## 5. Third-Party Services
The Bot interfaces with **Pronote**, an external service. Please refer to Pronoteâ€™s own privacy policy for information on how they handle your data.

## 6. Your Rights
Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, including:

- The right to access your personal data.
- The right to correct inaccuracies in your data.
- The right to request deletion of your data.

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact me.

## 7. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect operational, legal, or regulatory changes. Any changes will be posted with an updated "Last Updated" date.
